The goal of glottospace is to ...
The R package glottospace helps useRs to do geospatial analyses on linguistic and cultural data. 
    Examples include: matching linguistic datasets to their location, 
    calculating distances between languages based on their spatial location or linguistic features, 
    visualizing linguistic data on a map.

ADD some examples here with r code

## Installation

You can install the development version of glottospace from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SietzeN/glottospace")
```

## Workflow of glottospace

### gather
Download data from different sources, generate empty data structures that help you to add data in a structured way. 

### check
Interactive quality checks of user-provided data. Quickly check data coverage, missing values, etc. 

### clean
Clean data where necessary, recode values, select columns/remove redundant

### integrate
, and integrating them to use their full potential.
Join user-provided data with glottodata, add locations

### explore
search: search languages, filter all languages in a certain country

### enrich
add data, extract elevation of each language

### calculate
geodistances: calculating distances between languages, nearest languages, etc.
glottodistances: calculating similarities between languages based on linguistic/cultural features

### visualize
plotting linguistic and cultural data on a map
plotting distances between languages




## Some basic concepts: data formats

The glottospace package supports three main data formats: glottodata, glottobase, glottospace

1. glottodata. This is user-provided data that consist of a glottocode and any number of linguistic and/or cultural variables (features). 
``` r
glottodata <- get_glottodata()
head(glottodata)
```
2. glottospace. This returns points or polygons for each language in [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/). 
``` {r}
glottospace <- glottospace::get_glottospace()
head(glottospace)
```

3. glottobase. This is a boosted/enriched version of [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/). 
``` {r glottospace}
glottobase <- glottospace::get_glottobase()
colnames(glottobase)
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(glottospace)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
