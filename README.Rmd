# Introduction
The **glottospace** package facilitates the geospatial analysis of linguistic and cultural data. The aim of this package is to provide a streamlined workflow for working with spatio-linguistic data, including data import, cleaning, exploration, visualization and export. For example, with **glottospace** you can quickly match your own linguistic data to a location and plot it on a map. You can also calculate distances between languages based on their location or linguistic features and visualize those distances. In addition, with **glottospace** you can easily access global databases such as [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/) and [WALS](https://wals.info/) from R and integrate them with your own data. 

# Development
This package is still under active development. While the basic functionality has been implemented, we're still working on adding new functions and improving existing ones. While using **glottospace** you will certainly find bugs or encounter things you might find confusing. You can help me improve the package by:

- Sending an email to [Sietze Norder](mailto:s.j.norder@hum.leidenuniv.nl) with a clear description of the issue or error message.  
- Opening a new issue in the [glottospace issues page on GitHub](https://github.com/SietzeN/glottospace/issues)

# Citation
Once there is a stable version of the package we intend to write a paper about it presenting its full functionality. If you find the **glottospace** package useful, please cite it in your work:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
citation("glottospace")
```

The package uses a combination of [spatial packages](https://www.r-pkg.org/ctv/Spatial) and builds on two global databases: [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/) and [WALS](https://wals.info/). If you use **glottospace** in one of your publications, please cite these sources as well. 

# Installation

You can install the development version of glottospace from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("SietzeN/glottospace", INSTALL_opts=c("--no-multiarch"))
```
# Example
Before describing the functionality of **glottospace**, I give a quick demonstration of a typical workflow. 

## Plotting language locations on a map
Imagine you're working with languages in a particular region, and want to visualize them on a map. With glottospace this is easy! You could for example filter all languages in South America, and show which ones of them are isolate languages:

```{r example_glottomap}
library(glottospace)

## Plot point data:
glottomap(continent = "South America", color = "isolate")
```

Languages are often represented with points, while in reality the speakers of a language can inhabit vast areas. Glottospace works with point and polygon data. When polygon data is not available, you can interpolate the points and plot those. 

```{r example_glottopols}
## Filter by continent
glottopoints <- glottofilter(continent = "South America")
# Interpolate points to polygons:
glottopols <- glottospace(glottopoints, method = "voronoi", continent = "South America")
# Plot polygon data:
glottomap(glottodata = glottopols, color = "family_size_rank")

```

## Adding contextual data for specific languages

Imagine you are interested in a particular set of languages, and want to add some contextual information.

```{r example_glottosearch}
# Search languages:
glottosearch(find = "chichom")[,c("name", "family")]
```

There are 6 languages that resemble our search term, of which 4 belong to the Chicham language family. Let's view one of them on [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/):

```{r example_online}
glottocode_online("shua1257")
```

Let's see at which elevation Peruvian languages are spoken. First get and extract environmental data. 

```{r example_extractgeodata}
peruvians <- glottofilter(country = "Peru")
elevation <- geoget(geodata = "elevation", country = "Peru")
# Let's make a map:
geomap(elevation)
# Extract elevation for each language
elevperuvians <- extractgeodata(glottodata = peruvians, geodata = elevation)
```
Let's plot the elevation of the Peruvians:

```{r example_glottomap2}
glottomap(glottodata = elevperuvians, color = "elevation", ptsize = 0.85)
```


# Workflow of glottospace

The glottospace package offers a wide range of functions to work with spatio-linguistic data. The functions are organized into the following function families, of which the core function generally has the same name as the family to which it belongs: 

1. glottoget: download glottodata from remote server, or load locally stored glottodata.
1. glottocreate: create empty glottodata structure, to add data manually. 
1. glottocheck: run interactive quality checks of user-provided glottodata.
1. glottoclean: clean-up glottodata.
1. glottojoin: join user-provided glottodata with other (often online) datasets. 
1. glottosearch: search [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/) database for languages, language families, glottocodes, etc. 
1. glottofilter: filter/subset glottodata based on linguistic and geographic features/variables.
1. glottodist: calculate differences/similarities between languages based on their features (linguistic, cultural, environmental, geographic, etc.).
1. glottoplot: visualizing differences/similarities between languages.

1. glottospace: make glottodata spatial, add coordinates, add spatial points or polygons to languages.
1. geoget: download geographic data from online sources, or load user-provided geographic data.
1. geotools: extract environmental data and add those to glottodata. 
1. geodist: calculate geographic distances between languages.
1. glottomap: visualize linguistic and cultural data on a map.
1. glottosave: save output generated by glottospace (data, figures, maps, etc.).

## glottoget
You can load locally stored glottodata (for example from an excel file or shapefile). The glottospace package has two built-in artificial demo datasets ("demodata" and "demosubdata"). 

``` {r glottoget}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
head(glottodata)
```

You can also load glottodata from online databases such as [glottolog](https://glottolog.org/). You can download a raw version of the data ('glottolog'), or an enriched/boosted version ('glottobase'):
``` {r glottogetbase, message = FALSE}
# Two ways to load glottobase:
data("glottobase")
glottobase <- glottoget("glottobase")
colnames(glottobase)
```

## glottocreate
You can generate empty data structures that help you to add your own data in a structured way. These data structures can be saved to your local folder by specifying a filename (not demonstrated here). 

``` {r glottocreate}
glottocreate_data(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), variables = 3, meta = FALSE)
```

I've specified meta = FALSE, to indicate that we want to generate a 'flat' glottodata table. However, when creating glottodata, by default, several meta tables are included:

``` {r glottocreate_meta}
glottodata_meta <- glottocreate_data(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), variables = 3)
summary(glottodata_meta)
```

The majority of these metatables are added for the convenience of the user. The 'structure' table is the only one that is required for some of the functions in the glottospace package. A structure table can also be added later:

``` {r glottocreate_structuretable}
glottocreate_structuretable(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), 
                            varnames = c("var001", "var002", "var003"))
```

More complex glottodata structures can also be generated. For example, in cases where you want to distinguish between groups within each language. 
``` {r glottocreate_subdata}
# Instead of creating a single table for all languages, you might want to create a list of tables (one table for each language)
glottocreate_subdata(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), 
                     variables = 3, groups = c("a", "b"), n = 2, meta = FALSE)
```

## glottocheck
If you have your own data, you might want to do some interactive quality checks:

``` {r glottocheck}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
glottocheck(glottodata, diagnostic = FALSE)
```
I've now specified diagnostic = FALSE, but the default is to show some more extensive diagnostics (like a data coverage plot). 

You can also check the metadata:

``` {r glottocheckmeta}
glottodata <- glottoget(glottodata = "demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottocheck_metadata(glottodata)
```

## glottoclean 
Once you've loaded glottodata, you might encounter some inconsistencies. For example, data-contributors might not have used a standardized way of coding missing values.

``` {r glottoclean}
glottodata <- glottoget(glottodata = "demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottodata$structure
# glottodata <- glottoclean(glottodata)
```

## glottojoin
Join user-provided glottodata with other datasets, or with online databases.
``` {r glottojoin}
# Join with glottospace
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
glottodatabase <- glottojoin(glottodata, with = "glottobase")
glottodataspace <- glottojoin(glottodata, with = "glottospace")

# Join with a dist object
dist <- geodist(glottodataspace)
glottodatadist <- glottojoin(glottodata, with = dist)

# Join a list of glottodata tables into a single table
glottodatalist <- glottocreate_subdata(glottocodes = c("yucu1253", "tani1257"), 
                                       variables = 3, groups = c("a", "b"), n = 2, meta = FALSE)
glottodatatable <- glottojoin(glottodata = glottodatalist)

```

## glottosearch 
As demonstrated in the example above, you can search glottodata for a specific search term

You can search for a match in all columns:

```{r glottosearch1}
glottosearch(find = "yurakar")[,"name"]
```

Or limit the search to specific columns:

``` {r glottosearch2}
glottosearch(find = "Yucuni", columns = c("name", "family"))[,"name"]

```
Sometimes you don't find a match:
```{r glottosearch3}
glottosearch(find = "matsigenka")[,"name"]
```

If you can't find what you're looking for, you can increase the tolerance:
```{r glottosearch4}
glottosearch(find = "matsigenka", tolerance = 0.2)[,"name"]
```

Aha! There it is: 'Machiguenga'
```{r glottosearch5}
glottosearch(find = "matsigenka", tolerance = 0.4)[,"name"]
```


## glottofilter
filter, select, query

```{r glottofilter}
eurasia <- glottofilter(continent = c("Europe", "Asia"))
wari <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, glottocode = "wari1268")
indo_european <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, family = 'Indo-European')
south_america <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, continent = "South America")
colovenz <- glottofilter(country = c("Colombia", "Venezuela"))
# arawtuca <- glottofilter(glottodata = glottodata, expression = family %in% c("Arawakan", "Tucanoan"))

```


## glottodist
Quantify differences and similarities between languages
glottodistances: calculating similarities between languages based on linguistic/cultural features
```{r glottodist}
# In order to be able to calculate linguistic distances a structure table is required, that's why I specify meta = TRUE.
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottodist <- glottodist(glottodata = glottodata)

# As we've seen above, in case you have glottodata without a structure table, you can add it:
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = FALSE)
structure <- glottocreate_structuretable()
glottodata <- glottodata_addtable(glottodata, structure, name = "structure")
```

## glottoplot
Visualizing differences (distances) between languages based on linguistic, cultural, and environmental features. 

```{r glottoplot}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = TRUE)
glottodist <- glottodist(glottodata = glottodata)
glottoplot(glottodist)
```


## glottospace
This family of functions turns glottodata into a spatial object. As I've illustrated above, these can be either glottopoints or glottopols

```{r glottospace}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
glottospacedata <- glottospace(glottodata, method = "buffer", radius = 5)
# By default, the projection of maps is equal area, and shape is not preserved:
glottomap(glottospacedata)
```


## geoget
The geoget function supports both raster and vector formats. It either loads spatial data from a local path, or downloads is from a remote server.

```{r geoget}
climate <- geoget(geodata = "climate")[[12]]
names(climate) <- "precipitation"
geomap(climate)
```
## geotools
This is a large family of functions to work with spatial data. Most of these however, will probably not be called directly by the users. I've already demonstrated the function geodataextract() which can be used to extract environmental data for languages. You can also use a buffer radius to extract environmental features and summarize them. Here, I'm using a buffer of 10 km and summarize by taking the mean. 

```{r geotools}
dutchies <- glottofilter(country = "Netherlands")
climatedutchies <- extractgeodata(glottodata = dutchies, geodata = climate, radius = 10, fun = "mean")
glottomap(climatedutchies, color = "precipitation_mean", ptsize = 1)
```


## geodist
geodistances: calculate distances between languages, nearest languages, etc.
```{r geodist}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata")
glottodataspace <- glottospace(glottodata)
geodist(points = glottodataspace)
```

## glottomap 

With glottomap you can quickly visualize the location of languages. Below I show simple static maps, but you can also create dynamic maps by specifying type = "dynamic".

You can pass arguments directly to glottofilter

```{r glottomap}
glottomap(country = "Colombia")
```

However, you can also create maps with other glottodata. For example, we might want to create a world map highlighting the largest language families

```{r}
glottodata <- glottoget()
families <- glottodata %>% dplyr::count(family, sort = TRUE)

# highlight 10 largest families:
glottodata <- glottospotlight(glottodata = glottodata, spotcol = "family", spotlight = families$family[1:10], spotcontrast = "family", bgcontrast = "family")

# Create map
glottomap(glottodata, color = "color")
```


## glottosave 
All output generated with the glottospace package (data, figures, maps, etc.) can be saved with a single command. 

```{r glottoworldmap}
glottodata <- glottoget("demodata", meta = FALSE)
# Saves as .xlsx
glottosave(glottodata, filename = "glottodata")

glottospacedata <- glottospace(glottodata)
# Saves as .GPKG
glottosave(glottodata, filename = "glottodata")

glottomap <- glottomap(glottodata)
# By default, static maps are saved as .png, dynamic maps are saved as .html
glottosave(glottomap, filename = "glottomap")
```
